# 📝 Poem Parser Bot & API

This project enables you to extract structured poem information—such as the title and poem text in Markdown format—from images. You can interact with it in three main ways:

- ✅ Through a Telegram bot, which lets you upload, edit, and delete poems directly via chat commands.

- 🌐 Via a REST API that allows uploading poem data to the database or deleting existing poems.

- 📄 Through web views that display saved poems by author and title, providing a user-friendly interface to browse the poem collection.


## 🚀 Features

### Telegram Bot (main.py)
- Command-based interface to manage poems directly from Telegram.
- Commands to upload images, edit title, poem content, and author.
- Save poems to the database.
- Delete poems, authors, or all poems.
- Key commands include `/start`, `/done`, `/edittitle`, `/editpoem`, `/editauthor`, `/save`, `/deletepoem`, `/deleteauthor`, `/deleteall`, `/reset`, and `/help`.

### Flask Application (app.py)
- Provides web HTML views to display saved poems by author and title.
- Allows browsing all poems by a user, by author, or viewing a specific poem.
- Offers REST API endpoints to save poems, delete poems, delete authors, or delete all poems for a user.
- Includes basic validation and authorization via user_id.
